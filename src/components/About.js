                    <p> I am Ram Chapagai, a passionate computer programming student. I was not content with an Associate degree in
            Computer Programming from Southeast Tech and decided to pursue a
            Bachelorâ€™s degree in Application Development from Bellevue
            University. I have extensive hands-on experience and knowledge with
            Microsoft SQL Server, ASP.NET, C#, Java, Design pattern, OPP, and much more. I enjoy being challenged and
            engaging with projects that require me to work outside my comfort
            zone and knowledge set. I am continuously learning new languages,
            frameworks, and Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). Currently, I
            am actively looking for a software developer or related position.</p>
